# Brahma_model
A simple mathematical model to simulate the effect of Brahma knockout on cardiac cell differentiation. In addition to predict time course variations of signaling components activity and cells population and transcription factors contributing to brahma effect, this model has been used to perform bifurcation analysis of cell fate path using phase planes (phase.m) and develponing quasi-potential waddington diagram of cardiac and neural fates by utilizing method and codes from Bhattacharya et al. BMC Systems Biology 2011, 5:85.
Most parameters of the model have default values and upon new quantitative data avalibility, modelaccuracy can be increased by model parameters calibration.
