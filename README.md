# Brahma_model
# A simple mathematical model to simulate the effect of Brahma knockout on cardiac cell differentiation. In addition to predict time course variations of main signaling componens and transcription factors contributing to brham effect, this model has been used to perform bifurcation analysis of cell fate path using phase planes (phase.m) and develponing quasi-potential waddington diagram of cardiac and neural fate by utilizing method and codes from Bhattacharya et al.
